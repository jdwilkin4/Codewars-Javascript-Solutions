/* An AI has infected a text with a character!!

This text is now fully mutated to this character.

If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!

Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.

Example
text before = "abc"
character   = "z"
text after  = "zzz" */

//solution
const contamination = (text, char) => char === "" ? "" : char.repeat(text.length)

//test cases
Test.assertEquals(contamination("abc","z"), "zzz")
Test.assertEquals(contamination("","z"), "")
Test.assertEquals(contamination("abc",""), "")
Test.assertEquals(contamination("_3ebzgh4","&"), "&&&&&&&&")
Test.assertEquals(contamination("//case"," "), "      ")
